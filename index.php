        <h2>The Tales of the European Trip</h2>
        <p>
            The summer of 2008, my family and I went on a trip to tour Europe for two weeks! I know what
            you are thinking. It is impossible to tour all of Europe in two weeks. That's why I only visited
            the countries that has the most tourism attractions. We found a tourism group that would go to
            specific countries in Europe for a week. My mom thought it was a good idea so we joined them.
            So we started off from our home and went to London, England where we were to meet up with my aunt,
            who came from another country, and meet up with the tourism group.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We spent a couple days in London and we visited many attractions in London. When we meet up with 
            the tourist group, we made our way to Dover where we will be getting onto a ferry to cross the sea 
            to France. We did not stop at France however. Instead we went through France to go to Belgium where
            we stopped to get some Belgium chocolates! They were delicious. Afterwards, we made our way to 
            Amsterdam where we spend the night.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The next morning, we drove through Dutch village of Volendam. We visited the famous cheese factory
            and we tried out all kinds of cheese. Afterwards, we took pictures with the infamous windmills that
            can be found in Netherland. In the afternoon, we spent time in Amsterdam and just walked around the 
            city centre.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            On the third day, we made our way to Fussen, Germany. On the way there, we stopped in Berlin, Germany
            where we had lunch. By late afternoon, we reached the Neuchwanstein castle, which is the fairiest castle
            ever built. Disney's castle was based of this castle. In the evening, we made our way to Innsbruck, Austria.
            In the morning, we visited the Golden balcony and SWAROVSKI crystal and accessories store
            in Innsbruck. Afterwards, we were taken to look at the sky jump ramp that was build during one of the winter
            Olympics. Then we were on our way to spend the night in Venice, Italy.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In the morning, we took a boat ride to go to the island of Venice. We visited the St. Marks Basilica,
            the Doges Palace, and Bridges of Sighs. We were also able to ride on the Gondola. We spent an entire day here.
            The next day we made our way to Rome where we will stay for a day. We visited the Vatican City, the Colosseum,
            and Trevi fountain. On the next day we made our way to Florence and we visited the Florence Cathedral, Statue of
            David and Fountain of Neptune. The next day, we traveled to Pisa where we spent the day visiting Piazza dei Miracoli and
            see the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            After Pisa, we spent the entire day in the bus travelling to Switzerland. In Switzerland, we were on a two hours 
            journey up Jungfrau Mountain where we explored the ice palace and skied. It was a tiring day. On the second day,
            we walked around and enjoy the beautiful swiss scenery. The next day, we left the Alps and made our way back to
            Paris. The next day, we went to Disneyland Paris and spend an entire day there having fun. And the very next day,
            we went sightseeing the Notre Dame Cathedral, Place de la Concorde, Champs Elysees, Musee du Louvre, Arc de Triomphe 
            and the Eiffel Tower. We even stopped at a famous perfume factory by the grand Opera. The next day, we went back to
            London where we depart from the group and that was the end of my journey.
